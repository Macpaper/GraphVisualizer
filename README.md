# GraphVisualizer
Visualize DFS, BFS, Djikstras, and other graph algorithms using native Javascript

this shit being held together with strings and a rock this code straight ass 

btw to connect nodes hover mouse over a node, hold p, and release p on another node (might make this easier later)

hold B to do BFS (also make button for these later)

hold D to do DFS
